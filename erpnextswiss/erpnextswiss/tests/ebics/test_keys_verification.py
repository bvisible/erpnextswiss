This means the bank has your user activated BUT:
1. The keys being used don't match what was sent in INI/HIA
2. Possible causes:
   - Keys were regenerated after sending INI/HIA
   - Wrong keyring is being loaded
   - Keys weren't properly saved after generation
   
SOLUTION:
1. Check if keys were regenerated (look at timestamps)
2. If keys were regenerated, you need to:
   - Send new INI/HIA to bank
   - Get new INI letter
   - Have bank re-activate with new keys
3. OR reset connection and start fresh

1. First, fix the "(No connection)" issue:
   - Make sure you're selecting a connection in the Control Panel
   - The connection name should appear in logs

2. For error 061001, you have two options:

   Option A: Reset and start fresh
   - Reset the EBICS connection
   - Generate new keys
   - Send new INI/HIA
   - Generate new INI letter
   - Send to bank for re-activation

   Option B: Check if existing keys match
   - Verify keyring.json hasn't been modified after activation
   - Ensure the correct keyring is being loaded
   - Check that keys weren't regenerated
